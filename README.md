This command line tool is the next gen-iest of all the next gen command line utilities.
It's the macbook of the Up Time unix command line utility world. It's so simple its revolutionary.</p>

<p>It's so simple it doesn't have any options, or a man page. It's so simple you don't need one. Just put uptime3 into a folder in your path, and run it.
It's THAT SIMPLE. If I could I would mail every person who downloads this a big "GO!" button for thier desk, but I'm poor and no.
